Graphcis Templates for openSUSE

Contents of this folder are templates of different graphic elements that can be used for any openSUSE related announcements, wallpapers, and others. 

The main objective is that all content can be rearranged, edited, copy/pasted into new illustrations. We highly encourage the use of layers and separation of elements to facilitate its further use.

All content should be svg format so anyboday can reuse it. 

All contributions are welcome and appreciated.
